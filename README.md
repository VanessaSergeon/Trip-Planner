Trip-Planner
============

Fullstack Trip Planner
So far in this semester, we've covered JavaScript, HTML, CSS and just now jQuery. We are going to bring together all of those topics together for this project.

What we're building
We're building a new travel startup. It's a pain to come up with and organize travel plans. You've decided to solve this problem for yourself and others by building a Trip Planner app that allows for easy creation of day-by-day itineraries.

The Details
Each trip plan will be broken up by days. Each day, our travelers will need the following in their plans:

A restaurant to go to for Lunch and Dinner
A list of "things to do"
A hotel to stay at
They shouldn't need more than three restaurants and one hotel per day.

Each trip plan will accompanied by a beautiful Google Map, which will show all the locations for each day of the trip plan. This map should update when items are added or removed from the trip plan.

Sound fun? Cool. Now, let's start thinking about how to build this system.
